# Complete Server.js Template

This file is too large to write in one go. The complete server.js should include:

1. ✅ Server setup and imports (DONE)
2. ✅ EnhancedResponseGenerator class (DONE)
3. LanguageDetector class
4. ContextAnalyzer class
5. MultilingualResponses class
6. Yono777SupportAgent class with enhanced deposit concern flow
7. Receipt validation function
8. TelegramNotifier class
9. All API endpoints (/api/chat, /api/upload-receipt, etc.)
10. Server startup

Due to the file size (~3000+ lines), I recommend:
1. Restoring from backup if available
2. Or I can provide the complete file in sections

The enhanced deposit concern flow is documented in ENHANCED_DEPOSIT_FLOW.md and ready to be integrated.
